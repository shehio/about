## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/images/cairo.jpeg" >}}

I work as a backend engineer, and I live in Seattle. I’ll spare you all the tech references: Patagonia, Hiking, Robo-advisers. Honestly, no one puts it better than [Alexis](https://twitter.com/yayalexisgay/status/1249057146051821568).

But it didn’t start there, did it? Here’s my one-minute about.

Problem-solving has always fascinated me. This led me to study computer science as an undergraduate. In my early twenties, I became curious about the financial markets and their [efficiencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis). This curiosity prompted me to return to school, where I got a degree in financial mathematics. Here’s the [complete story](https://www.projectnash.com/what-is-project-nash/).

In grad school, I rekindled my interest in Artificial Intelligence. I led a book club to discuss new research papers featuring [RL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) and [GANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network). I also implemented the algorithms from these papers to play video games and generate realistic artificial faces.

In another life, I would’ve pursued an academic position or could’ve become a journalist. I like to research different topics and explain them to myself/others using simple analogies and stories. I created a website to do just that. I wrote about many domains from [relationships](https://www.projectnash.com/500-days-of-summer-and-attachment-theory/) to [game theory](https://www.projectnash.com/aliens-the-fermi-paradox-and-the-dark-forest-theory/) and [socioeconomic mobility](https://www.projectnash.com/the-great-gatsby-and-the-demise-of-the-american-dream/) to [efficiency](https://www.projectnash.com/randy-pausch/).

When I’m not working or learning about the world, I like to hike and play different sports. I also appreciate slow-paced activities like trying different foods and playing board games.
