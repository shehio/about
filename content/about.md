## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/images/qaitbay4.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

In the past few years, I’ve worked as an engineer. It has provided a great deal of structure in my day, organizing my life around projects, situations, and obstacles. Sometimes I thought about life as a collection of systems and processes with different dependencies, efficiencies, and bottlenecks. Engineering also gave me an eye for detail and had me deconstruct complex systems.

In grad school, I studied finance, statistics, and mathematics. I learned how to “hack the markets and make billions of dollars.” Yet when it was time to practice, it didn’t work out very well. I led a research book club and sought to build intelligent machines that learn to play games or generate realistic artificial faces.

As my technical knowledge expanded, so did my appreciation for humanities and arts. Science pursues external questioning, while art pursues internal reasoning. Art seeks self-realization, which is the noblest of all pursuits.

We all pride ourselves on our individualism and our longings, however unrealistic they are. We look for the perfect word, on a perfect day to say it to the perfect person, and of course, take the perfect shot. Nowadays, I find unmatched joy in writing, wordplay, references, and symbolism. They enthrall the whole of me.
