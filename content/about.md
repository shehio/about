## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/images/qait.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

We all are multifaceted, having as many dimensions as we wish to show different people regardless of how contradictory these facets are. Reducing a person to a bio on social media is a haphazard endeavor. Being complex like everyone else, I could never describe myself using one article or a sentence no matter how hard I tried. Yet here we tread.

For the past few years of my life, I’ve been working as an engineer. It provided a great deal of structure in my life. I thought in lists and dependencies, and schedules. I described things as systems, with different efficiencies, and bottlenecks. It gave me an eye for detail and had me deconstruct complex systems.

In grad school, I studied finance, statistics, and mathematics. I studied how to “hack the markets and make billions of dollars.” I led a research book club and sought to build intelligent machines that learn to play games or mimic face generation.

Now looking back at it all, I don’t think my work or my projects defined me. It’s my curiosity that defined me all those years and continues to. As I grew older, my curiosity shifted from seeking to understand the world to understand myself.[1]
