## Grab Coffee

Although I live in gloomy Seattle, I try to spend as much time every year in my sunny hometown, Alexandria, Egypt. I am always down to meet new people and learn new disciplines. If you need to discuss some new project or brainstorm some ideas, letâ€™s grab a coffee or just meet virtually. Ping me on [shehabyasser@gmail.com](mailto:shehabyasser@gmail.com).
