## A little More Subjective

In the about section, I wrote about my scientific mind. But that’s only one dimension. As my technical knowledge expands, so does my appreciation for the humanities and the arts. Science pursues objectivity, logic, and rationality, while art pursues subjectivity and relativity. An artist’s poem or painting reflects how they see the world and not what’s truly there. In short, an artist seeks to attain self-realization, the noblest of all pursuits.

As human beings, we pride ourselves on our individualism and our longings, however unrealistic they may be. I’m no different. I’m constantly on the hunt for the perfect expression, the perfect day to say just the right thing to the most special person.

Nowadays, I welcome my individualistic interests, my unverifiable truths, and all of my subjective thoughts. This all-embracing way of thinking is reflected in the unmatched joy I attain from living life as it comes and capturing the special moments.

## Why I write

I like to write. I publish what I write online because I know that I’ll come back and critique myself one day in the future. It’s one way to hold myself accountable and realize how my views evolve over time. When I revisit my writings in the future, I will remember all the hope, interest, passion, attention, pretense, foolishness, embarrassment, and regret, and still be glad I wrote them all down and lived on another day.
