### A little More Objective

In the about section, I wrote about how technical knowledge contributed to my endeavors to understand the world. Yet, secular knowledge is merely a distraction if it doesn’t bring us to our actual purpose here on earth: Glorifying God.

See, the same logical concepts and, more generally, epistemological methods that are used in the scientific discourse are the ones used to establish [cosmological arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalam_cosmological_argument) and [ontological arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_the_Truthful). We can’t have an [infinite regress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_regress). We can’t have contingent existence without a [necessary](https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/wajib-al-wujud) one.

In our limited lives, we are fueled by emotions. Without them, we spiral into meaninglessness and aimlessness. The best analogy of how these emotions are to be garnered and even capitalized upon is that of [Ibn al-Qayyim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Qayyim_al-Jawziyya) in his [Madarij as-Salkeen](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AC_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%86_%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86_%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%84_%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%83_%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF_%D9%88%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%83_%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86): “The heart, in its journey to Allah the Almighty, is like that of a bird: love is its head, and fear and hope are its two wings. When the head and two wings are sound, the bird flies gracefully. If the head is severed, the bird dies. If the bird loses one of its wings, it then becomes a target for every hunter or predator.”
