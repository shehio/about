<p>Since early childhood, I have been curious about computers’ inner workings, particularly how software manipulates computer architecture. My early interest in computers led me to study computer science as an undergraduate.</p>
<p>After graduating, I worked as a software engineer on many exciting projects that included client-side applications and server-side distributed systems. My work has trained me to have an eye for detail and think of the butterfly effect of any trivial change in a codebase.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, I became curious about the financial markets, specifically how the wizards of Wall Street “hack the markets” to make billions of dollars. This newfound curiosity prompted my return to school, where I got my master’s degree in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_finance">financial mathematics</a>.</p>
<p>Grad school rekindled my interest in Artificial Intelligence, where I led a book club to discuss new research papers featuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">RL</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">GANs</a>. In my spare time, I built artificially intelligent agents to play video games and generate realistic artificial faces.</p>
<p>I have an engineering mindset, and I embrace my aptitude for problem-solving. In my daily routine, I strive for consistency, efficiency, and automation. I think of life as a combination of different systems; each has unique dependencies, efficiencies, and bottlenecks. I work best with a schedule that leaves few loose ends open, one that quickly redirects me to the next project, situation, or obstacle to tackle.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I unwind in different ways. I like to hike various trails and play a bunch of sports. I also appreciate the pleasures of slow-paced activities like meeting up with family and friends, trying different foods, and playing board games.</p>
<p>Through it all, I always try my hardest to catch as many captivating moments as possible through photography and journaling. These moments are what we live for!</p>
