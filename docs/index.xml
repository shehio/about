      <description>About Me  Since early childhood, I have been curious about computers’ inner workings, particularly how software manipulates computer architecture. My early interest in computers led me to study computer science as an undergraduate.
After graduating, I worked as a software engineer on many exciting projects that included client-side applications and server-side distributed systems. My work has trained me to have an eye for detail and think of the butterfly effect of any trivial change in a codebase.</description>

      <description>A little More Subjective In the about section, I wrote about my scientific mind. But that’s only one dimension. As my technical knowledge expands, so does my appreciation for the humanities and the arts. Science pursues objectivity, logic, and rationality, while art pursues subjectivity and relativity. An artist’s poem or painting reflects how they see the world and not what’s truly there. In short, an artist seeks to attain self-realization, the noblest of all pursuits.</description>
