      <description>About Me  In the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked as an engineer. It has provided a great deal of structure in my day, organizing my life around projects, situations, and obstacles. Sometimes I thought about life as a collection of systems and processes with different dependencies, efficiencies, and bottlenecks. Engineering also gave me an eye for detail and had me deconstruct complex systems.
In grad school, I studied finance, statistics, and mathematics.</description>
