      <description>About Me  I have spent the past few years of my life working as an engineer. Engineering has provided me with a great deal of structure in my daily life, constantly organizing my schedule around the next project, situation, or obstacle. Now I approach any project as a collection of systems and processes with different dependencies, efficiencies, and bottlenecks.
In graduate school, I studied finance, statistics, and mathematics. I was curious about how the economy works and how the wizards of wall street “hack” the markets and make billions of dollars.</description>

      <description>Grab Coffee Although I live in gloomy Seattle, I try to spend as much time every year in my sunny hometown, Alexandria, Egypt. I am always down to meet new people and learn new disciplines. If you need to discuss some new project or brainstorm some ideas, let’s grab a coffee or just meet virtually.
